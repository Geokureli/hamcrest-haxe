Hamcrest for Haxe
====================

Port of **[hamcrest](http://code.google.com/p/hamcrest/)** for Haxe.

Provides a library of matcher objects (also known as constraints or predicates) allowing 'match' rules to be defined declaratively, to be used in other frameworks. Typical scenarios include testing frameworks, mocking libraries and UI validation rules.

Note that hamcrest is not a testing library, it just happens that matchers are very useful for testing.
